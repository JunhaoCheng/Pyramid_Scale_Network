# Pyramid_Scale_Network
This is the PyTorch version repo for [Exploit the potential of Multi-column architecture for Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05779), which delivered a state-of-the-art, straightforward and end-to-end architecture for crowd counting tasks. We also recommend another work on crowd counting([Deep Density-aware Count Regressor](https://github.com/GeorgeChenZJ/deepcount)), which is accepted by ECAI2020.
